# Planning Summer Programs

## Administrative
<!-- Rename section to working with schools and districts, create a timeline for the program, ITEMS FOR SCHOOLS - funding, teachers, location, meals, technology, host information sessions to inform and recruit distrcits -->
<!-- Timeline - October - reach out to schools, December - identify interested schools, schools identify funding, January - recruit teachers and mentors, February - revise training and any materials & begin student recruitment, March - confirm with schools location, teacher, students, training, April and May - Hire and Youth Compliance, Training for Teachers and Undergrads, June Camps begin -->
-   Contact the school district STEM or science department to offer an
    opportunity to host a summer program.
    -   If you know a teacher that would like to host the summer program
        and has permission from their school principal to host the
        summer program, work with them and the school team.
-   They should work with you to identify a target school to host the
    summer program if a school is not already in mind.
-   Work with them to identify a school, classroom, essential personnel
    on-site with contact information, materials available, technology --
    computers and learning management software, summer program dates
    (four to five full days, or eight half days), meals, snacks, outdoor
    activities/equipment, emergency plans
-   Develop fliers to advertise for the summer program in the target
    school(s). The flier should include the program dates, times,
    location, meals provided, a brief program description, and a link to
    the registration.

## Compliance
<!-- Compliance Edits - work with your YC coordinator, camp insurance, etc.; Waivers - release for UF - liability and photos *Update Waiver Document, Informed consent - Parents for research, Assent Students consent, *Add Behavior Contract, *Parent Pick Up Authorization-->
<!-- Make into subsections - Compliance Students, Compliance University Level, compliance varies by district and suggest checking with schools and distrcits. Check with schools for volunteer portals and volunteer procedures -->
-   Parents must sign a permission slip or waiver to acknowledge their
    student's participation in the program. We recommend that this
    permission form gets sent via email with the research consent form
    (see [IRB Requirements]) at least a week before the start of the
    summer program. Parents can sign and submit scanned copies of the
    form via email. Always have hard copies available on the first day
    of the program for parents to complete during student drop-off.
    -   An example waiver for UF youth summer programs can be found in
        [*Appendix A: Parent Student Waiver*].
-   Photo consent and release are required to be signed by the parents
    of students
-   The addition of a behavior contract subsection to the consent form
    could be helpful
    -   Agrees that parents and students should be on their best
        behavior
    -   Provides a process for teachers to reach out to parents in the
        event of bad behavior
-   Establish a clear sign-in and sign-out procedure that complies with
    school and organization requirements
    -   School staff should be in charge of student dismissal
-   Create a digital sign-in and out for internal records in addition to
    a paper sign-in and out
-   **ALL PERSONS INTERACTING WITH STUDENTS MUST GO THROUGH THE PROPER
    COMPLIANCE MEASURES**
    -   FERPA Training
    -   Youth Protection Training
    -   Level 2 Background Screening and Fingerprinting
    -   Teacher badge credentials (if at home school location)
    -   Blue State Vendor Badge (if outside home school)

## Assessment

<!--Assessment Comments -   -->

### IRB - Assessment Plan

During the summer program, the study focused on assessing student
motivation and identity as computer scientists and engineers when
completing computer science-related activities throughout the program.
This is done through surveys at the start of the program and at the end
of each day, in addition to student interviews and observations. We also
want to determine students' skills and cognitive processes as they
engage with computational thinking (CT) and engineering design thinking (EDT).

A longitudinal study will be conducted to assess the impact of attending
the summer program on grades and higher-level course registration. A
multiple regression analysis will determine what the significant
predictors of grades are.

-   *Do students' demographic data on summer experience and motivation
    for CT and EDT activities influence/predict their grades in STEM
    subjects?*
-   *Is the summer program experience moderating the effect of the
    predictors with their grades?* Regression model (test the
    significance of the slopes):

$$ 
Grade/enrollment = a + m_1 (URM) + m_2 (gender) + m_3 (ethnicity) + m_4 (program attendance) + m_5 (program motivation)
$$

### IRB Requirements

*Only if completing a research study*

-   If you are running a research study alongside the summer program,
    you need to complete
    -   an IRB with your institution and
    -   with the school district, the summer program is in
-   Parents must complete a consent form for their students to
    participate in the study. We recommend that this research consent
    form gets sent via email with the permission form (see [Compliance])
    at least a week before the start of the summer program. Parents can
    sign and submit scanned copies of the form via email. Always have
    hard copies available on the first day of the summer program for
    parents to complete during student drop-off.
    -   An example consent form can be found in [*Appendix B: Informed
        Consent*]
-   Students will need to complete a Student Assent form only if their
    parent's consent to participate in the study and the school district
    allows student assent forms.
    -   An example assent form can be found in [*Appendix C: Student
        Assent Form*]

### No IRB -- Assessment

Students understand norms for working together and how to treat and work
with a Micro:bit.

Students are successful in programming basics:

-   understanding how to create a process map
-   basic programming of a Micro:bit to make a name badge
-   understanding logic in programming and how to code it
-   troubleshooting and debugging
-   problem-solving

Students can apply programming basics in designing a rock, paper,
scissors game and use the Micro:bit to collect data to analyze using
graphing software (excel, google sheets).

Students can navigate the design process and work with partners to
develop a functional design for a Micro:bit pet and a technical design
challenge.

## Student Registration

A digital student registration should be developed to allow parents to
register their students. The survey needs to collect the following
student and parent information:

-   Student Full Name
-   Student School Email
-   Student Birthday
-   Student Home Address
-   Parent/Guardian Full Name
-   Parent/Guardian Email
-   Parent/Guardian Phone Number
-   Parent/Guardian Home Address
-   Select Summer program Location and Dates (if multiple)
-   Designated Pick-Up People
    -   Contact Information (Phone Number)
    -   Relation to Student
-   Emergency Contact Information
    -   Name, Phone Number, Email, Address, Relation to Student
-   Grade Level
-   Allergies -- Food or Environmental

## Program Leaders

Classroom teachers make great candidates for leading this summer
program. It is something that teachers with little programming
experience to a lot of programming experience can lead. This program
also makes the transition of applying Micro:bits in the classroom more
straightforward and more authentic in the application.

For the middle school age range, UF requires a ratio of one teacher for
every ten students for a day program. We recommend that there need to be
at least two adult teachers or paraprofessionals leading the program.
The classroom experience is helpful when teaching a classroom of
students through the program.

All teachers must complete the required training and credentialing to
participate in and lead a summer program. Required training and
credentials include:

-   FERPA Training
-   Youth Protection Training
-   Level 2 Background Screening and Fingerprinting
-   Teacher badge credentials (if at home school location)
-   Blue State Vendor Badge (if outside home school)

The opportunity for high school students to volunteer can be arranged.
You will need to work with the school and school district to ensure
proper protocols and compliance measures are in place. This includes
on-site school supervision, volunteer permission forms for parents to
complete as they are minors, and appropriate training.

## Learning Management Systems

We have found it helpful to distribute summer program materials using a
learning management system. Students each get their copy of the
activities to work on during the program activities. This allows summer
program facilitators to see students work and check progress actively.
We have used Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom to distribute student
activity frameworks.

The summer program can be run without digital documents. The frameworks
can be printed, or students can work on their paper with the activity
instructions projected to the class.

## Industry Connections

### Mentor Recruitment

The summer program is designed to include a technical design challenge
that is related to challenges seen in an industry environment. To do
this authentically, schools, districts, and summer program organizers
should invite employees from 3-4 local industries to present to the
students. They should go over their company, what the industry does,
their role, and their educational background. At the end of the
presentation, the industry mentor will present a challenge or problem
they see in their field that the students can solve by programming their
Micro:bits.

### Field Trips

We saw that most school districts operate on a four-day schedule during
the summer. This meant that most summer programs were designed to be
4-day programs. This leaves the perfect opportunity to schedule an
industry field trip or trips with the mentors that proposed the design
challenges. Students and program leaders will get the chance to tour the
company, see what they do in action, and how their design challenge
solution works in the company that proposed the challenge.

# Training for Facilitators

## Training Expectations

To complete a Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers Summer Program, the
facilitators must understand what the program expectations are:

-   Understand the purpose and goals of the program
-   Understand the role of the facilitator of the program
-   Be able to guide students through the program activities and help
    them acquire skills
-   Understand the purpose of the icebreakers and what to focus on
-   Facilitate group work and critical thinking
-   Review the program activities to understand the meaning, leader, and
    student roles
-   Practice Microsoft Micro:bit activities to be able to troubleshoot
    with students during the program

## Tips for Success

-   Stay organized. Organization is your lifeline in a program with so
    many moving parts
-   Start training early (Roughly two months before your program starts)
-   Use team bonding activities such as icebreakers and food socials to
    ensure that all teams of facilitators are ready to work with one
    another

## How to Ensure that Facilitators Are on Task

Throughout training and programs, facilitators might get off task. To
ensure that each facilitator has completed the training for the day, we
recommend using Microsoft Teams or a similar platform to create
daily/weekly assignments where the facilitators work through the
activity guide, such as students would be doing during the program. The
implementation of assignments makes an organized base for both the
organizers of the program and the facilitators.

## Training Schedule

To create a successful program, program organizers must provide training
to facilitators. We recommend introducing the facilitators to the
Microsoft Micro:bit two months before the program begins. This ensures
they are familiar with the device and are prepared to teach the
students. We also recommend a 4-week bootcamp which makes the
facilitators go through the program activity guide, such as what the
students would be doing during the program. Program organizers should
hold a meeting once a week (or more, depending on the facilitators)
where they go through the program expectations, program activities,
logistical information, and more.

**Office Hours**

Facilitators might have questions on different Micro:bit activities or
program days throughout the training. Hosting office hours is highly
recommended to ensure all facilitator questions are answered. Program
organizers should schedule 1-3 office hours each week. The program
organizer should put these questions and answers in a separate document
to send out to the team in case other facilitators might have the
question later.

## Summer Program Content

The program will be going through Microsoft Micro:bit activities and
projects. An activity guide has already been created with a step-by-step
schedule for each program day and related activities. We have mapped out
three layouts of the program composed of a full day, 7-hour, or half
day, 4-hour programs. All of the facilitator guides can be found under
the Facilitator Guides section.

## Logistical Components of the Programs

**Surveys**

If you are running a research study, the facilitators must administer
surveys that help track the students' progress, excitement, and quality
of work in the programs. To ensure surveys are correctly administered,
please follow the guide below:

-   Every Day: Sign In and Sign Out Surveys and End of Day Survey (this
    survey will not be issued on the last day of the program)
-   First Day of Program: Pre-survey
-   Last Day of Program: End of Program Survey

**Consent Forms**

Reference the [Compliance] and [Assessment] sections for more
information. Facilitators are also responsible for distributing,
collecting, and organizing forms such as consent forms from the student
and parent, research waivers, and any other forms the participating
districts might require. For best results, we recommend sending digital
copies of the forms one week before the start of the program and
organizing which students/parents have completed the forms. You should
also print out extras of each form to send back with students who have
either not completed said form or have filled it out incorrectly

## How-To Videos

For facilitators that are not familiar with Microsoft Micro:bits or for
those who are having trouble with activities, we have created short
How-To videos that go through each activity in the summer program, its
components, and the expected results.

# Facilitator Guides

Find listed below detailed facilitator activity guides for the three
versions of the camps: 4-day full day, 5-day full day, 8-day half day.
The guides are designed to walk through what the facilitators do during
the summer program activities. It also provides possible solutions to
the coding activities. The guides are flexible and can be rearranged to
accompany lunches and breaks.
